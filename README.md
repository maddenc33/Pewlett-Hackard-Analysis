## **Overview**

  1. The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
  2. The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
  3. A written report on the employee database analysis

    - Design an ERD that will apply to the data.
    - Create and use a SQL database.
    - Import and export large CSV datasets into pgAdmin.
    - Practice using different joins to create new tables in pgAdmin.
    - Write basic-to intermediate-level SQL statements.

### Analysis

- After conducting the analysis it was found that there is currently a large number of employees of retirement age holding senior titles (57,668/90,398 = 64%) with around **64%** of the staff to retire. Please reference the Unique Titles table below.
	

## Summary

- At the moment at Pewlett Hackard, **64%** of their employees are getting ready for retirement or being redirected to their mentorship initiatives, which will mean that they are likely going to need an extensive hiring process in the upcoming years. Since a significant amount of future retirees hold Senior positions the mentorship program should provide a capacitation buffer for the extensive expertise that will be leaving the company in the years to come.
